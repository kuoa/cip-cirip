# Project Giraffe [A social network]
Project Giraffe is a mini-social network implementation.

For this project, I used a Tomcat server together with Java Servlets for the server side, combined with a MySQL database for user related information and a Mongo database for user content (messages, images, videos). A REST api is provided. For the client side, I used Javascript and jQuery, together with the Bootstrap framework.

For more details check the client / server folders.
